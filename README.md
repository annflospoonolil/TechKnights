## Idea
Entrepreneur-Investor Connection Bot:
This Telegram bot helps connect aspiring entrepreneurs with investors. It features a selection of startup categories that entrepreneurs can choose from, allowing them to find investors in their chosen field. Investors can also register themselves through a dedicated website, making the connection process smoother.

## Features 
1. Entrepreneur Startup Categories: The bot presents a set of categories for entrepreneurs to choose from. Upon selecting a category, it displays a list of investors interested in that field along with their contact details.

2. Investor Registration: Investors can easily register themselves through a web interface, adding their details and preferred investment categories.

3. Matching Investors with Entrepreneurs: Once an entrepreneur selects their startup idea category, the bot shows a list of investors in that category, including other relevant details.

4. Communication Channels: Entrepreneurs and investors can communicate directly through Telegram, or via email or other modes (e.g., phone number), depending on the contact details provided by the investors.

   
## Libraries used

## How to use
For Entrepreneurs:
    1. Add the bot on Telegram and select your startup idea category.
    2. The bot will provide a list of potential investors in that field with their contact details (Telegram, email, etc.).
For Investors:

## Future Implementations
  1. Investment Tracking: Providing a way for both entrepreneurs and investors to track their investment progress and business development directly through the bot, including reports and analytics.
  2. Entrepreneur Networking: A networking feature that allows entrepreneurs to connect with each other, share experiences, and potentially collaborate on projects.
  3. Feedback System: Implementing a feedback system where both entrepreneurs and investors can rate their interactions. This will help refine matches and improve the overall user experience.
